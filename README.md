# Random Cat Facts - simple React App 

## Description
- Simple React app using API for random cat facts (https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/). Just because I love cats :) 
- Made as part of a series of mini-projects to teach myself React. 
- Has a Node JS and Express backend for Heroku deployment. 
- It appears that the API currently returns only 5 cat facts, thus not making for a very engaging read. A record of the project now lives here: https://random-catfacts.netlify.app/
